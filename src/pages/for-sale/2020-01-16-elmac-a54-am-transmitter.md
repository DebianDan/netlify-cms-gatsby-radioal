The Multi-Elmac A54 and A54H are (AM) plate modulated mobile transmitters manufactured in the early 1950's. They were VFO or crystal controlled and covered five bands, four fixed and one assignable. The fixed bands were 75, 20, 11, and 10 meters. Yes, we had the 11 meter assignment in the early 50's. The assignable or "X" position on the band switch could be field modified to any one of 160, 40, 15, or 6 meters. The final tube is an 807 with push-pull 6L6 modulators. The A54 ran on nominally 500V @ about 200 milliamps and a filament voltage of 6.3 or 12.6 volts. It was a simple but rugged design and in good shape and properly aligned these transmitters give excellent results. The A54H has a 6AU6 microphone pre-amp for use with a high impedance crystal or dynamic microphone while the A54 is designed to be used with a carbon microphone.
